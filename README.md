# My name is Sylvain Tran.
## I'm a student of Computer Science and Computation Arts.

I develop using web programming technologies (three.js, phaser.js, p5.js), and both client-server with real-time technology (Unity), Socket.io, and Node.js. 
My game design focus is on **emergent narrative gameplay design**, and **multiplayer economy system design**.
My background includes a degree in Psychology (B.A. Hons.), and I'm currently completing my Computer Science (B.Sc.) and Computation Arts (BFA) dual degree.
