# My name is Sylvain Tran.
## I design and build multimedia experiences.
## Story so far: My focus is on designing multimedia experiences:
- Core Game Prototypes
- Interactive Multimedia Website Experiences (Canvas or WebGL embeds)

### I use web programming technologies (three.js, phaser.js, p5.js), and real-time technology (Unity). 
### My game design focus is on **emergent narrative gameplay design**, and **multiplayer economy system design**.
