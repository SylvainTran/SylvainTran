# My name is Sylvain Tran.
## I design and build digital multimedia experiences.
## My core focus is on:

- Interactive Multimedia Website Experiences (Canvas or WebGL embeds)

I program using web programming technologies (three.js, phaser.js, p5.js), and both client-server with real-time technology (Unity, Socket.io, Node.js). 
My game design focus is on **emergent narrative gameplay design**, and **multiplayer economy system design**.
