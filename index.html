            process: " I started by learning how to use tools like Yarn Spinner, and once I figured out how to quickly create cinematic sequences and camera cuts, I had the idea of adding 'action moments' in-between the dialogues. Hence the concept of a Visual Novel shooter. I learned how to use AI finite-state machines using InVector to control combat action sequences. I am working on developing clear game level flow, and mapping simple objectives to the actual spatial layout of the level to make the experience intuitive and fun for the player. Furthermore, when I realized how all the action was between the player and Lyra (the companion AI), I decided that they'd have to fight each other (to death?) at some point for dramatic intensity. Making the player reflect about 'lying' as a narrative mechanic became interesting to me. I am currently learning how to add level design elements (traps and puzzles) using Unity's Visual Scripting Graph and with C# directly. I am also greyboxing and doing lookdev myself using Krita, Blender and 3dsMax.",
