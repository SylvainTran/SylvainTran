            <h3>Process</h3>

            <p>When designing, I focus on the core experience that I want the user to think about. I gather references of similar levels or environments to get inspired, and I put them in a pure ref board to consult them easily. I use rapid prototyping to iterate, and I get and use data to answer design questions.</p>
            <p>This process is repeated until the desired result is obtained.</p>
            <p>I usually start with fast ideation of high level concepts that I would like to test on a sheet of paper, then I try to do a paper prototype on a grid sheet.</p>
            <p>When the initial ideas are clear and I start to understand how I can relate the concepts to my technical knowledge at a more intuitive level, I fire up a game engine and start translating my paper prototypes in the editor. I will start by greyboxing fast and doing some adjustments (lookdev). After I get an overall picture that I'm satisfied with, I start adding primitive placeholders for the actors in the level, and I look for re-usable code that I can use to get started quickly.</p>
            <p>As I work in the game engine, I start to make a list of requirements that emerge from my bottom-up prototyping. Usually at the end of this phase, I run into a major design question or problem, for which I require user testing to answer. I get my level out, and ask someone to try it. I design a questionaire using known research methods and questionaire design, making sure my questions do not induce any biases or become overloaded. I use ratings that can be measured (i.e., Likert scales), and I try to get a decent sample size of players. After a few rounds of testing, I revise and make adjustments, plus add a few of my own touches.</p>

            <h4>Some rules and heuristics I tend to follow to illustrate my process:</h4>            
            <p>Problem: A mechanic, encounter or part of the level does not feel interesting.<br>Rule: Before getting into scripting, can I use VFX and animations to get some oomph or juice factor? Can I find solutions in art, or how I present the information to the player?</p>
            <p>Problem: The experience seems to lack for something.<br>Rule: Can I vary variables that I already have at hand? Can I think of small variations that could make the experience more interesting or challenging before adding something else?</p>

            <h4>Problem Solving Using Analytical and Scientific Methods</h4>

            <p>Given my background in Computer Science and Engineering, as well as Design, Computation Arts and Psychology, I am well versed in several different iterative workflows. I draw from research and design methods, and I may use statistical analysis to balance game mechanics or levels if possible.</p>
            <p>I also incorporate my research background in the prototyping process, when designing UX questionaires and when validating test results.</p>
